Bank_Loan_Modeling
The dataset is from Thera Bank, a small regional bank. The model helps predict which depositors with a higher likelihood to convert to depositors.

This project is a classification issue, aiming to target customer to offer bank loan offer. Three types of classification models are built, models include decision tree, KNN, and logistic regression. Due to the imbalance of the two classes, we also built other 3 models on the resampled data.

Steps and tasks:
1. Import the datasets and libraries, check datatype, statistical summary, shape, null
values etc
2. Check if you need to clean the data for any of the variables
3. EDA: Study the data distribution in each attribute and target variable, share your
findings.
● A number of unique in each column.
● A number of people with zero mortgage.
● A number of people with zero credit card spending per month.
● Value counts of all categorical columns.
● Univariate and Bivariate analysis
4. Apply necessary transformations for the feature variables
5. Normalise your data and split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 
70:30 respectively.
6. Use the Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer buying
personal loans.
7. Print all the metrics related to evaluating the model performance
8. Build various other classification algorithms and compare their performance.
